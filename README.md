# Eden-Flywheel-aggregator
EDE Chinese name "Web3 Eden-Flywheel aggregator" is a decentralised platform using blockchain technology, dedicated to address and solve the pain points in the current blockchain field, and realise the wheel movement of flywheel consensus. 

In EDE ecosystem, everyone can be planted through mining. Working together to build and develop a platform that is fair, transparent and trustable. ‘She’ will get rid of the death spiral trap and the fatigue of the mining system.

EDE concept and logic:
EDE total emissions: 69000 
Base Pool: 50000 
planting contracts: 19000
The reward for 19000 planting contracts in 10 phases, 1900 per phase, will be injected into the second phase of the flywheel cycle as the previous phase dries up.
The transaction fees are: buying 6%, selling 6%
/ which the LP dividend is 3%.
/ Which 1% will be destroyed
/ which 1% will be built to base
/ which 1% of the return planting contract will be filled into phases 11 to 12 of the flywheel cycle

1: A cycle of 7 days.

2: At the time of initial participation, the parent coin was planted

3: When the cycle day arrives, the planting yield will be 100%+10% of the parent coin.

4: Every planting requires 3% FI to be used as gas, all FI consumed will be destroyed.

5: In case of no planting for 21 days in a row, it will be regarded as a contract overtime, then the output will be cut down to 50%.

6: When the EDE in the planting contract is not enough to deal with, it will trigger the contract rebirth, which will trigger 150% of the production of the parent coin.

7: The rebirth period is 7 days, and the planting yield in the rebirth period is 70% of that in the parent coin.

8: When the rebirth cycle ends, the smart contract will be triggered to supply the corresponding amount of EDE into the pool of planting contract.

9: If planting is done before the cycle starts, it is considered that a new parent coin has been planted.

10: After the planting cycle, if the amount of planting is greater than or less than the parent coin, it is considered to have planted a new parent coin.

11: After the planting cycle, if the amount of planting is equal to the parent coin, then immediate production will be triggered.

The daily output of fuel FI is 0.5% of the total pool,  1 FI is equals to 1 USDT.

1: Build your own community and get a 30% share allocation of FI

2: Stake EDE to get 20% of FI share allocation

3: Stake EDE+USDT in LP to obtain 50% share allocation of FI

We will be open to share all the source codes and discarding permissions to implement an innovative economic model that will be entirely governed by the community, including your own forums and community building!

EDE is a complete Web3 ecosystem operation, which is only the beginning, when the community reaches a strong consensus, we will be empowered with unlimited energy. Good luck to everyone!
